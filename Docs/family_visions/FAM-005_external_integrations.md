# FAM-005 External Integrations Vision

## Purpose

This family vision records durable product direction for external trigger intake, plugin integration, external control surfaces, and safe integration boundaries.

## Vision Summary

External integrations should make Nexus more useful without turning outside triggers into uncontrolled authority. The product should remain explicit about what invoked an action, what data crossed a boundary, and what trust model applies.

## Accepted Direction

- Treat external trigger intake as a governed capability boundary.
- Require clear source/origin identity and validation before external actions affect user-visible behavior.
- Keep plugin and external-control expansion tied to explicit user consent, proof, and rollback paths.
- Preserve first-party/local behavior where possible.
- AI-native provider/API integration, external tool calls, plugin-triggered AI actions, and provider-visible data must follow `Docs/ai_runtime_and_trust_architecture.md` and family-local privacy/safety boundaries before implementation.
- External integrations must not become hidden provider escalation, silent monitoring, or a bypass around permission-state, Local-Only Mode, Privacy Lockdown, or Trust Journal expectations.

## Implementation Boundaries

- This vision does not admit a plugin runtime, external API execution, or third-party monitoring.
- This vision does not admit provider/model execution, external AI calls, private connector setup, or AI Product Contract import by itself.
- Active integration work needs Branch Readiness approval for security, privacy, validation, and user-facing proof.
