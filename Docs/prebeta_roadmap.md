# Nexus Pre-Beta Roadmap

## Purpose

This document is the sequencing and release-posture layer for current Nexus `pre-Beta` planning.

Use it for:

- latest public prerelease truth
- release-debt posture
- current sequencing posture
- recently closed milestone context

Do not use it as:

- a second backlog
- a workstream execution diary
- a substitute for canonical workstream records

## Authority And Boundaries

This roadmap is subordinate to:

- `Docs/development_rules.md`
- `Docs/phase_governance.md`
- `Docs/codex_modes.md`
- `Docs/feature_backlog.md`
- `Docs/workstreams/index.md`
- `Docs/closeout_guidance.md`

That means:

- backlog owns identity
- workstream docs own promoted-work feature-state, branch-local evidence, and closure records
- phase governance owns repo-wide lifecycle, proof, timeout, and stop-loss rules
- closeouts and rebaselines own epoch summaries
- roadmap owns sequencing and release posture only

## Lane Types And Release Fields

Use these lane types:

- `docs-only`
- `implementation`
- `rebaseline`

Use these release-floor values:

- `no release`
- `patch prerelease`
- `minor prerelease`

Use these release-state values when relevant:

- `active delta`
- `merged unreleased`
- `released`
- `closed`

## Current Release Posture

Current merged truth indicates:

- latest public prerelease: `v1.4.0-prebeta`
- latest public release commit: the `v1.4.0-prebeta` tag target
- merged unreleased non-doc implementation debt exists: no
- the latest public released implementation milestone is FB-037 curated built-in system actions and Nexus settings expansion in `v1.4.0-prebeta`
- current phase: `Release Readiness`
- phase status: `No Active Branch`
- blocker after release execution: none for FB-037
- next concern on the active branch: FB-038 Branch Readiness governance/admission repair before implementation

That means the released FB-027 interaction baseline, the released FB-036 authoring-and-callable-group milestone, the released FB-041 deterministic callable-group execution milestone, and the released FB-037 built-in catalog milestone are now part of the current public shared pre-Beta baseline.

## Current Release Debt Owner

### None

- no merged-unreleased implementation workstream currently owns Release Debt after FB-037 release execution
- any future release debt must be introduced explicitly by a later merge or release-packaging branch

## Selected Next Workstream

### FB-038 Taskbar / Tray Quick-Task UX And Create Custom Task Surface

- selection state: `selected next workstream`
- Record State: `Registry-only`
- Branch: `feature/fb-038-taskbar-tray-quick-task-ux` created for Branch Readiness only
- sequence: current active branch remains in Branch Readiness until prior-branch canon cleanup, governance repair, and FB-038 admission are clean
- Minimal Scope: Branch Readiness admission and planning for the shell-facing quick-task entry surface, initially limited to defining the smallest safe taskbar/tray or Create Custom Task UX seam above the released FB-027 interaction baseline, FB-036 authoring baseline, FB-041 callable-group execution baseline, and FB-037 built-in catalog baseline.
- implementation rule: no FB-038 implementation may begin until Branch Readiness repairs prior-branch canon drift, creates the active FB-038 authority record if admitted, and exits cleanly to Workstream

## Most Recent Released Workstream Context

### FB-037 Curated Built-In System Actions And Nexus Settings Expansion

- status: `released`
- lane type: `implementation`
- release floor: `minor prerelease`
- target version: `v1.4.0-prebeta`
- release state: `released`
- canonical workstream doc: `Docs/workstreams/FB-037_built_in_actions_and_settings_expansion.md`
- sequencing note: released the curated built-in Windows utility catalog for Task Manager, Calculator, Notepad, and Paint while preserving saved-action override authority, authoring collision protection, confirm/result surfaces, and callable-group behavior

## Prior Released Workstream Context

### FB-041 Deterministic Callable-Group Execution Layer

- status: `released`
- lane type: `implementation`
- release floor: `patch prerelease`
- target version: `v1.3.1-prebeta`
- release state: `released`
- canonical workstream doc: `Docs/workstreams/FB-041_deterministic_callable_group_execution_layer.md`
- sequencing note: released deterministic stored-order callable-group execution, stop-on-failure semantics, group-aware failure-path reuse, and confirm/result status alignment while preserving single-action behavior

### FB-036 Saved-Action Authoring And Callable Groups

- status: `released`
- lane type: `implementation`
- release floor: `minor prerelease`
- target version: `v1.3.0-prebeta`
- release state: `released`
- canonical workstream doc: `Docs/workstreams/FB-036_saved_action_authoring.md`
- sequencing note: released bounded custom-task authoring, callable groups, inline group quick-create, explicit trigger modeling, and the final exact-green authoring hardening without changing the locked typed-first overlay contract or widening into Action Studio behavior

## Recently Closed Workstreams

### FB-027 Interaction System Baseline

- status: `closed`
- lane type: `implementation`
- release floor: `patch prerelease`
- target version: `v1.2.9-prebeta`
- release state: `released`
- canonical workstream doc: `Docs/workstreams/FB-027_interaction_system_baseline.md`
- sequencing note: remains the locked interaction baseline below the later released FB-036 authoring and callable-group milestone

### FB-035 Release-Context Fallback Hardening

- status: `closed`
- lane type: `implementation`
- release floor: `patch prerelease`
- target version: `v1.2.7-prebeta`
- release state: `released`

- lane type: `implementation`
- release floor: `patch prerelease`
- target version: `v1.2.6-prebeta`
- release state: `released`
- canonical workstream doc: `Docs/workstreams/FB-034_recoverable_diagnostics.md`

- lane type: `implementation`
- release floor: `patch prerelease`

- target version: `v1.2.3-prebeta`
- release state: `released`
- canonical workstream doc: `Docs/workstreams/FB-028_history_state_relocation.md`

## Current Sequencing Reading

Current merged truth indicates:

- the released FB-027 baseline remains part of the locked current interaction floor
- the released FB-036 authoring-and-callable-group milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-041 deterministic callable-group execution milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-037 built-in catalog milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-035 lane is closed
- the recent released workstreams above remain part of the locked current baseline
- merged unreleased non-doc implementation debt exists: no
- no active implementation workstream is currently admitted
- post-release repo truth after this release branch merges resolves to no active implementation branch and no FB-037 release-debt blocker
- successor-lane branch creation remains deferred until FB-038 enters Branch Readiness from updated `main`
- if a branch changes release-facing canon, those canon updates must land on that same branch before PR readiness is allowed
- post-release canon repair is emergency-only when merged canon is already stale or external drift made pre-merge prevention impossible
- the released FB-027 baseline does not authorize further saved-action authoring, resolution, voice, Action Studio, routines, profiles, hotkey cleanup, or shutdown-confirmation work by inertia
- remaining future candidate spaces now explicitly recorded in the backlog include:
  - FB-038 for taskbar or tray quick-task UX including Create Custom Task, selected as the next implementation workstream after updated `main` includes the FB-037 release-state canon
  - FB-039 for external trigger and plugin integration architecture
  - FB-040 for monitoring, thermals, and performance HUD surfaces
- those candidate lanes must be selected deliberately rather than bundled together as one implicit interaction continuation
- FB-037 Branch Readiness does not imply automatic continuation into any remaining candidate lane

Use canonical workstream docs for execution detail.
Use the backlog for item identity.
